# FUNCTIONAL DESIGN

*WildlifeNL: Applications and Data Platform*

## Introduction
This functional design provides the basis for the development of the WildlifeNL system. It incorporates the content of earlier documents about user stories and functionalities as gathered from interviews with the potential end-users, as well as the results of the brainstorm session organized by the researcher team. Ultimately unifying the wishes of the end-users with the requirements of the researcher team. Moreover, this functional design provides boundaries to the scopes of the different applications. 
To address feasibility an earlier version of this document was reviewed by the WildlifeNL consortium partners that participate in the implementation (Gamr-holding and Fontys University of Applied Sciences) and review comments have been processed in this version. 

## Roles
In the workshop regarding the WildlifeNL user stories, 7 different roles were defined (Agrariër, Omwonende, Recreant, Faunabeheerder, Kuddebeheerder, Terreinbeheerder and Onderzoeker). Due to time limitations, the functionalities that originate from the Kuddebeheerder role will not be implemented for now, effectively putting that role on pending. Moreover, the roles Researcher and Administrator were added later. As a result, the manageable roles structure is as follows.

- 👲 Recreationist
- 🧑🏻‍💼 Inhabitant
- 🧑‍🌾 Agrarian
- 🧝🏻 Nature Area Manager
- 🧑🏻‍🔧 Wildlife Manager
- 🧑‍🔬 Researcher
- 🧑🏻‍💻 Administrator

## API support

A REST API will support the user stories as stated below. The current state of the API support is expressed with the following symbols:

- ✅ implemented
- ❌ not (yet) implemented


## Applications & User Stories
To address the objectives of the WildlifeNL project, five end-user applications have been defined and functionalities, collected from User Stories, have been added to each application. Note that functionalities with a priority of 4 or lower have been added for archiving purposes but will not receive any resources for implementation yet. Two applications are aimed at mobile use using a smartphone or tablet, whereas the others are aimed at large screen use in a web browser on a laptop/desktop, but also functions, albeit less comfortable, in a mobile web-browser on a smartphone or tablet. All applications share data via the WildlifeNL API (see chapter Architecture). An Administrator role is defined, but no application will be created yet for this role. Current administrators will use the default user interface of the Wildlife API to activate functionalities assigned to their role.

### Wild Gids
*Being able to enjoy human-wildlife interactions and reduce possible negative encounters with wildlife to recreate confidently and well-informed in a living lab*

📱 Smartphone App : 👲 Recreationist, 🧑🏻‍💼 Inhabitant  
   
I love being in and learning about nature, but feeling safe is important to me. Learning about the wild animals around me increases my positive nature experience. Knowing how to behave around wild animals or how to interact, or not interact, with them makes me feel more secure. I enjoy the freedom to choose activities like running, cycling, horseback riding, or walking. Sometimes I like being alone in nature, other times with my family and dog, or in a larger group. It is helpful to know where wild animals are so I can plan my route accordingly. Occasionally, I find it exciting to take photos of wildlife, but I want to make sure that it is appropriate or at the right time. I find it useful to register interactions I have with wild animals as this supports researchers, and if I spot something broken, I wish to report it for maintenance. Getting a notification with information on how to behave when I am approaching a potentially dangerous animal gives me peace of mind and reduces the probability of me performing undesirable behaviour (e.g., behaviour that leads to conflict with the wild animal or that negatively affects the welfare of the wild animal).

### Wild Rapport
*I live with wild animals and want to do so in a way that safeguards the well-being of myself and my property but also that of the wild animals.*

📱 Smartphone App : 🧑🏻‍🌾 Agrarian, 🧝🏻 Nature Area Manager, 🧑🏻‍🔧 Wildlife Manager 
  
I want to be better aware of the wild animals around me so that I can enjoy the positive interactions but also mitigate the negative ones. Being better informed about the animals around me and about ways to promote coexistence with them increases my tolerance towards these wild animals. I want to ensure that my pastures, fields, animals, garden, house, and property are safe from damage by wild animals. Knowing how to protect my land is crucial. Understanding which animals are near my property or the road I often travel on and how to respond to their presence and interact with them can help me avoid risks. It is essential for me to receive honest and proactive information, like if there are crop-raiding animals nearby and how to respond. I need the ability to report interactions with wild animals (e.g., wild animal observations, vehicle collisions, damage to property) and clarity on potential compensation and the necessary steps. Learning more about my wild animal neighbours, who they are, what they do and why they do this, helps me understand them better and increase my tolerance. Sharing positive experiences with my wild animal neighbours with others in my neighbourhood increases our shared sense of place and belonging.

### Wild Radar
*Adaptive management of wild animals and human-wildlife interactions for more positive and less negative human-wildlife interactions*

💻 Web App : 🧝🏻 Nature Area Manager, 🧑🏻‍🔧 Wildlife Manager
   
Note that this application presents a slightly different user interface and set of functionalities dependent on the role(s) of the logged in user. Some functionalities are associated with several roles for different reasons, and some are exclusive to a specific role. It is possible for a user to have multiple roles and the application should adapt accordingly. 

#### Nature Area Manager
I serve as a manager of nature areas and my responsibility is providing space and developing habitat for wild animals but also for humans to recreate. Within this role, I am responsible for human-wildlife interactions in my areas, where I aim to reduce negative interactions and impacts on wildlife and humans present within these areas. I am also a neighbour, e.g. with adjacent agricultural lands or villages, and in that context responsible for maintaining respectful relations with these neighbours. Since human-wildlife interactions often cross the boundaries of my areas, I also need to work with my neighbours to manage these interactions. I manage wildlife and their habitat for the benefit of biodiversity, incl. the wildlife, but also people inside and around my areas. This means I also need to manage people. I offer education and guided tours. Additionally, I survey the flora and fauna, providing advice for nature management. I may be specialized in public engagement, management, ecology, or supervision.

#### Wildlife Manager
My responsibility is to prevent or reduce damage or nuisance caused by certain wild animals while at the same time safeguarding, and sometimes promoting, the well-being of animals and their populations. With other wildlife managers, I am part of  a Wildbeheereenheid (Wildlife Management Unit), which works together with a Faunabeheereenheid at the provincial level. Our tasks may include the monitoring of wild animal populations and of the damage they cause, managing the numbers and behaviour of wild animals to prevent them to cause damage, ensuring management is conducted responsibly, and focusing on improving wildlife habitat and biodiversity.

### Research Connect
*Being able to access the data from the data platform to use it in my research*

💻 Web App : 🧑‍🔬 Researcher
 
Regarding my research, I wish to use applications of WildlifeNL to run experiments in order to gather data that I can use to address my research objectives and/or hypotheses. To do so, I would like to create questionnaires that end-users of the applications can fill-out, and I would like to send push messages to the end-users, hopefully nudging them into certain behaviours. Lastly, I want to access the data platform in a way that allows me to extract complete datasets and/or aggregations that I can use in my own research. The data platform does not need to present the data in aesthetically appealing ways, I just need the raw data.

*Assign roles to other users and manage the content of the API backend.*

💻 Web App : 🧑🏻‍💻 Administrator
 
To ensure that the WildifeNL API and its backend contain the correct information and this information is provided to the correct users in the other applications, I can add, edit, and disable data elements. Also, I can assign and revoke roles for other users.
Note that no specific admin tool will be created, for now the administrators will use the default user interface of the WildlifeNL API.

## Data Platform
Because the WildlifeNL system incorporates multiple applications addressing several different roles and devices, data needs to be exchanged between those applications. A central Data Platform is responsible for accepting, retrieving and storing data for the WildlifeNL project and is disclosed via the WildlifeNL API (application programming interface). The functionalities that the Data Platform offers are the direct result of the user stories and requirements of the applications that it needs to support, and thus its capacity to store data is bound by the requirements for those data by the WildlifeNL applications. In more technical terms: the data platform serves as a data back-end for the applications, rather than as a repository for data in general. However, the data platform can be extended as to integrate with existing data repositories in such a way that those data can be retrieved by the WildlifeNL applications as well.

## Requirements
WildlifeNL is a research project that aims primarily for societal impact. The purpose of the project is not to integrate the scattered wildlife management data landscape in the Netherlands, nor to explore the latest digital technologies, but rather to apply existing technologies in novel ways as possible solutions for issues in wildlife management in the Netherlands. Consequently, the goal of the data platform is primarily to implement the user stories as collected within the WildlifeNL consortium, and secondarily to support the multidisciplinary team of researchers (ecological, social, legal, governance, and communication perspective) in both data collection and "nudging" of behaviour of actors in the wildlife management domain.
Therefore, the data platform should be ‘lightweight’, in particular it should adhere to the following general principles:
- Loose coupling: The architecture should be open. It should be easily to add new existing monitoring systems (camera-traps, collars, etc.). This also implies that the project should actively avoid vendor-lock-in.
- Flexible: The data to and from the apps should be configurable such that researchers should be able to make selections (queries) in the collected pool of data, and they should be able to set up their own questionnaires that can be send to the various end-users.
- Open-source: The code that will be developed in this project should be open-source (both for the apps and the data platforms). This fits with the open access philosophy of NWO. 
- Privacy-by-design: Due to the potentially sensitive nature of some of the data that will be collected in the WildlifeNL project, the data storage solution will be provided by Utrecht University, with the ultimate goal to prevent misuse of personal data.

## Quality Attributes

### Performance
The WildlifeNL Data Platform will be hosted on the Utrecht University’s RedHat OpenShift platform (OpenShift), which is a containerized virtual environment that can automatically scale system resources based on load.

### Usability
The Data Platform discloses a REST API using JSON formatted data, serving multiple endpoints that address functional requirements as specified for the WildlifeNL applications. The API documentation is generated automatically from its code base as to ensure that it does not get outdated when new functionality is added or improvements are made to existing functionality. This API documentation is available at a public URL.

### Security
Before any application can connect with the Data Platform it needs its user to pass an authentication and authorization procedure. Authentication happens by the user offering an email address. An authentication code will be send to that address and if the user can provide that code back to the Data Platform, the email address is validated and the user is authenticated. This is form of Simple Authentication for the Web (SAW) an implementation of the ‘One Time Password (OTP) by email’ scheme ([Bonneau et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.48456/tr-817)) which allows authentication without users needing to possess and remember a password. Authorization is based on the Roles as mentioned above in this document. By default any user can utilize the functionalities associated with the roles Recreationist and Inhabitant without any further need for authorization. An administrator can assign additional roles to registered users to allow them to utilize more functionalities. This split of default roles and additional roles allows for quick registration of new users but protects sensitive functionalities behind a layer of security using a flat Role Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism ([Sandhu et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1145/344287.344301)).

### Maintainability
Components of the Data Platform run as containerized pods on the OpenShift platform and can be pulled up and torn down using the OpenShift management console. Moreover, OpenShift offers container builders that allow direct rebuilding of a specific container from a git repository when a newer version is available.

### Extensibility
The Data Platform will be developed in an object oriented modular design, facilitating industry standard ways for extending its functionalities. Given that the development process is iterative, earlier versions of the Data Platform will have limited functionality and later renditions will extend upon the earlier versions. This approach allows for future extensions based on evaluations of earlier versions even for functionalities that have
 
## Architecture
The applications work together in an architecture that defines the WildlifeNL system as specified in the image below, and cater for all the roles that are being addressed. The Data Platform discloses an API for the application to connect to and exchange data. Moreover, the WildlifeNL system allows for extension by accepting data from external systems. Multiple of such systems can be connected to the WildlifeNL system for example to acquire information on the location of animals from different sources (collar, camera trap, acoustic sensor, etc.) as well as visitor counts or additional geographic information. As an initial setup an existing Trapper ([Bubnicki et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12571)) installation is added to allow Natural Resource Managers to deploy camera trap projects. Trapper offers an API for data exchange with the WildlifeNL system and thus can be connected to the WildlifeNL API. Also, an existing system for collar data from the consortium member Smart Parks will be connected to the WildlifeNL API.

## Conceptual Model
The conceptual model describes the main concepts as used in the WildlifeNL system and how they are associated in a high-level overview.

![conceptual-model](assets/conceptual-model.svg)
 
A User has one or more Roles, and can report an Interaction with wildlife of a certain Species. As a result of the Interaction the user is possibly presented with a Questionnaire to fill out. Based on the answers given in the questionnaire it is possible that the user receives a Message. Moreover, the user can have an Encounter (being close to each other in terms of time, latitude and longitude) with an Animal of a certain Species and receive a Message about this encounter. Lastly the User can specify a Zone of interest and receive an Alarm when an Animal enters that zone, when an Interaction is reported within that zone, or when a Detection is reported within that zone. A Detection is a record of a sensor, for example a camera trap, having detected a member of a certain Species.
