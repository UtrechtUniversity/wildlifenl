# wildlifenl

Project `wildlifenl` is the backend API for the WildlifeNL system. It caters for the storage and retrieval of all data in the WildlifeNL digital ecosystem and provides logical integrity over this ecosystem's apps and data exports. It adheres to the open/closed principle and allows other systems to interact with it in a well-defined way specified by its API end-points and schemas.

## License

Given the nature of this API and it being developed in a trans-disciplinary consortium, this software uses the MPL-2.0 license, rather than any other license, for the following reasons:

- Encourage contributions by ensuring that changes to the licensed files remain open.
- Allow integration with proprietary software without imposing open-source requirements on an entire project.

## Documentation

See the `docs` folder for more information.
